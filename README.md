## Features
### User Interface (UI) Design and Information Extraction
The LLM Based HR Analytics System presents an intuitive and visually appealing user interface, designed to facilitate smooth navigation and an exceptional user experience. This UI enhances interaction and information retrieval, streamlining the hiring process.

### Data Extraction from Resume - Spacy Model
Our system utilizes the powerful Spacy model to accurately extract relevant information from candidate resumes. This enhances the accuracy of candidate profiles and improves the hiring process.

### CV Ranking - Cosine Similarity with Dynamic Weights
To rank candidates, we employ a sophisticated cosine similarity algorithm with dynamic weighting. This method ensures accurate matching of candidate qualifications with job requirements, leading to improved candidate selection.

### Content Generation - Langchain, OpenAI
We leverage Langchain and OpenAI for content generation, enabling us to craft tailored messages and communications with candidates. This personalized approach enhances candidate engagement and communication.

### Screening Questions - Flan - T5 XXL
The Flan model with T5 XXL powers our system to generate highly relevant and effective screening questions. These questions are aligned with job requirements and help assess candidates' suitability for specific roles.

### Job Recommendation - Naive Bayes Algorithm
For job recommendation, we employ a Naive Bayes algorithm that considers candidate qualifications and preferences to suggest suitable job roles. This feature streamlines the job search process for candidates.

### Chatbot System - LLAMA
Our integrated LLAMA chatbot system provides real-time assistance and answers to candidates' queries. This chatbot enhances engagement, provides information, and enhances the overall candidate experience.

### Screening Interview and Evaluation
The screening interview process is thoughtfully structured to assess candidate skills and suitability. It captures and evaluates candidate responses, enabling HR teams to make informed decisions. This comprehensive approach goes beyond resumes, leading to improved hiring outcomes.

### Speed
The LLM Based HR Analytics System is designed for speed and responsiveness. It efficiently handles a substantial candidate pool without compromising accuracy. Timely results are delivered, ensuring effective hiring decisions.

### Value Adds
- Auto-Scoring: The system automates scoring of candidate responses, saving HR time.
- Real-time Collaboration: Facilitates real-time collaboration among HR team members during evaluation.
- Feedback Loop: Provides an iterative feedback loop to enhance the algorithm over time.
